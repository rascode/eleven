What could go right? <code>*Everything.*</code>

[11ty]('11ty.dev') is an open-source static site generator with all the suace and none of the nonesense.  This space (and related 11-week sprint) is dedicated to all of the 11ty Neophites and Aficionados who want to learn the ropes and/or hone thier skills.

We will learn to together and we will grow together as we explore the many faces and features of 11ty through hands-on experience, trial-and-error + mutual exchange of tips, tricks and best practices.
